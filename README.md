# CECHS-EPA-Blood-Graphic-Designer
Using Python, I desgined a script that creates a simple graphic to display the capillary blood concentrations of different elements from samples retrieved from the Emory CECHS laboratory division. I utilized pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to first parse data from an excel sheet, extract data, and then display it in a neat and easy to understand graphic that shows a participant (From the Lab-held event) the concentrations of certain elements in their blood. This included Lead, Manganese, Cobalt, and Arsenic.
